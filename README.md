The 3D surface presentation of this function is as below:

We experiment 11 different step size and the following plot shows its relationship with iteration number (limited up to 10,000).

It is noticeable that itâ€™s difficult to converge with either too small or too big step size. 
Using step size 0.002075 (4304 steps), the path is as below:

The final error is  9.99e-05, which is acceptable. The path is stable; however, it becomes slow when entering the turning point and getting close to the target (1, 1) point.
The path of the other two GD variants are shown as below:
